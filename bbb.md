## PSALM - Psalm 24[^3]
</summary>

The earth belongs to God, along with everything on it. \
Every person, every animal, every plant. \
God made the seas and put the rivers in their banks.\
**Who is full of glory? The Lord our God, that‚Äôs who.** \
So, who are we to think we can go to God‚Äôs house?\
Who are we to talk to God‚Äôs face? \
We have clean hands and pure hearts, and we tell the truth. \
That‚Äôs who can spend time with God. \
**Who is full of glory? The Lord our God, that‚Äôs who.** \
God will bless us. \
Open up your gates. \
Break down the doors. \
Here comes God. \
You ask, who is full of glory? The Lord our God, that‚Äôs who. \
Open up your gates. Break down the doors. \
Our God is full of glory. \
Again you ask, who is it again? \
**Who is full of glory? The Lord our God is full of glory.**

Question for Reflection

The lectionary readings suggest comparing the exuberant dancing and merrymaking of David to Paul‚Äôs enthusiastic description of the Christian‚Äôs calling, while contrasting these to the deathly revelries of Herod‚Äôs court. How do you know which present-day occasions to celebrate with all your might and which to speak out against?

Household Prayer: Morning

Creator of light,

I greet you as the morning dawns.

Thank you for this new day.

May it be for me a sign

and an anticipation of your coming kingdom.

Fill me with the energy I will need

to love all whom I meet today.

I pray that I harm no one

and that I may have the mind of Christ

as I live in the world he came to save.

Receive my body, mind, and spirit

as a living sacrifice of thanksgiving

for the love you show me in Jesus Christ.

And where my wholeness is broken

by sin or sickness or the weight of the day,

let me seek you in repentance,

reach out to you for healing,

and lay my burdens before your throne of grace.

When the time for rest comes,

let me find my repose in you,

my comfort in life

and my hope of life everlasting,

through Jesus Christ my Lord. Amen.

Household Prayer: Evening

Faithful God,

where I am now

the earth is turning away from the sun

so that for other parts of the world,

the day is just beginning.

Thank you for abiding with us

through the day and through the night.

As I gather up thoughts of the hours just past

and reflect on what, if anything, they mean,

guide my meditations.

There were times when you used me

to love someone with Christ‚Äôs love,

to encourage someone with a word from the Spirit,

to comfort someone with your tender touch,

to challenge someone with your mighty arm.

Let me not be proud, arrogant, or boastful.

Let me rejoice in your goodness and mercy.

I have sinned against you and others this day.

I am sorry.

By your Spirit, help me to turn away from my sins.

Forgive me through the grace of Jesus Christ.

Let me go to my rest this night in peace,

trusting not in my own goodness,

but rejoicing in your glory.

If it is your will,

let me rise to a new day,

giving thanks and praise to you,

the triune God, now and forever. Amen.
